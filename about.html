        <h1>MISSION</h1>
        <h2>To provide access to financial services to everyone</h2>
        <h1>VISION</h1>
        <h2>To enable the unbanked to access financial services for economic growth</h2>
    
        <p>Nas Financials is a financial institution that is based in Nuba, Sudan. It started opperations in Janaury 2024 with the main objective of offering access to financial services to the unbanked people 
            of Nuba in Sudan, who don't have access to financial services.</p>
        <p>At the moment we are only offering Money Remittance services but our goal is to grow to be a fully functional Bank that would offer many financial services to the unbaked people of Nuba</p>
        <p> The Company was started with with an experience when the Founder and CEO Almarat Arnu Ngutulu faced a challenge to receive money from his father from Nuba. This happend very many times not 
        only with him but with many close Nuba people who lived with him in the same area and prompted him to think and come up with a solution. 
        <p> He carried out Research to understand the problem in detail before thinking of coming up with any solution. He sent out questionaires to friends and collegues in East Africa and Abroad and Inperson interviews in Nuba. 
        The research showed that everyone was facing this problem are indeed of a working solution</p>
        <p> In trying to come up with a solution with his knowledge in Finance and Tech, he realised that the people of Nuba belong to the 1 Billion population around the World that are unbanked and have no access to financial services and 
          and a solution to bring access to all financial services is thus needed and that is why Nas is here to offer that.  </p>
        <p> Access to financial has been linked to poverty alleviation and economic development by World Bank. Populations accessing financial services are doing better interms of living starndards compared to those not accessing financial services according
        to research carried out by World Bank and it is therefore in our interest to give access to the people of Nuba access to financial services to raise there living standards</p>

        <p> Nas financial is located in Kumo, South Kordofan in Sudan</p>
